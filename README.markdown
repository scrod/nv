### Notational Velocity  ALT

A fork based on [DivineDominion's](github.com/divineDominion/nv) which adds a few features I'd been looking for (and let me get some coding practice).

## About Notational Velocity ALT ##

Notational Velocity ALT is a fork of the original [Notational Velocity][notational] with some additional features and some interface modifications. It is a work in progress. I'm not listing it as a beta, as that would imply that it was on its way to being its own product. It's an experiment, and I hope you enjoy it!

## What it is ##

Notational Velocity is a way to take notes quickly and effortlessly using just your keyboard. You press a shortcut to bring up the window and just start typing. It will begin searching existing notes, filtering them as you type. You can use &#x2318;-J and &#x2318;-K to move through the list. Enter selects and begins editing. If you're creating a new note, you just type a unique title and press enter to move the cursor into a blank edit area. Check out the descriptions at [notational.net][notational] for a more eloquent synopsis.

## Additional Features ## 

Notational Velocity ALT adds:

* Widescreen (horizontal) layout option
* Shortcut (&#x2318;-&#x2325;-N) to collapse the notes panel
* Markdown, Textile and MultiMarkdown support with Preview window
* HTML source code tab in the Preview window for fast copy/paste to blogs, etc.
* Unique interface design changes
* Fixes for a couple of bugs/annoyances
* Customizable HTML and CSS files for the Preview window
	* You can use Javascript in the templates to do a few neat tricks

## Customization ## 

After the first time you run the Preview window, look in `~/Library/Application Support/Notational Velocity` and you'll find two files:` template.html` and `custom.css`. If you're handy with HTML and CSS, feel free to customize these in whatever way you like. You can add Javascript as well, but you'll need to load external scripts from a url or using a full file:// path. If worst comes to worst, you can just delete or rename your customizations and the default files will be put back in place automatically.
